A diagram of the operator's receptive field helps:

                          <- X ->

                          -------
                       ---       ---
                     --             --    |
                    /                 \   |
                    |                 |   Y
                    \                 /   |
                     --             --    |
                       ---       ---
                          -------

The operator is based on the Gaussian:

	G_s(x) = exp(-0.5/(s*x)^2)

Extending this into two dimensions gives:

	O(x,y) = G_sx(x) * G_sy(y)

where `sx' and `sy' define the extent of the operator in the X and Y
directions.  Now, tangentially (in the X direction) the operators are
divided into `xn' tangential components (xn is really an integer
although for purely interface regions it shows up as a float), where
the divisions are achieved by multiplying the operator by one or two
partition functions based on:

	       / 0, if x <= -0.5,
	p(x) = | 1, if x >= 0.5,
	       \ exp(-1/(0.5+x))/(exp(-1/(0.5+x))+exp(-1/(0.5-x))), otherwise.

This function is a partitioning building block of degree 1 around x=0.
In order to actually partition the function we choose
x_1,...,x_n such that the regions O_1,...,O_n have equal areas:

                        x1  x2  x3
                         |   |   |

                          -------
                       ---   |   ---
                     --  |   |   |  --
                    /    |   |   |    \
                    | O1 |O2 | O3| O4 |
                    \    |   |   |    /
                     --  |   |   |  --
                       ---   |   ---
                          -------

The degree `deg' of these partition is simply a multiplier used when
partitioning to determine how sharp the transition from one region to
the next is.  Thus the regions are defined as:

	R1(x,y) = O(x,y)  p(x1-deg*x)
	R2(x,y) = O(x,y) (p(deg*x-x1) + p(x2-deg*x) - 1)
	R3(x,y) = O(x,y) (p(deg*x-x2) + p(x3-deg*x) - 1)	
	R4(x,y) = O(x,y)  p(deg*x-x3)

The two central regions (R2 and R3) have matched stabilizers of the
form stab*G'_sx(x) attached. These are scaled by the variable `stab.'

The last variable is `sep' which is the offset of the *lateral*
components used to build up the line or edge specific operators.
(e.g. the line2 operator consists of four components:
	L1(y) =  G'_sy(y-sep)
	L2(y) = -G'_sy(y+sep)
	L3(y) = -G'''_sy(y-sep)
	L4(y) =  G'''_sy(y+sep).)

So the variables are in two groups: tangential and lateral.

> float line2_sx   = 2.5; /* T: the sigma of the X Gaussian (length). */
> float line2_xn   = 4;   /* T: the number of tangential regions. */
> float line2_deg  = 2.0; /* T: the degree of the tangential partitions. */
> float line2_stab = 0.2; /* T: the weight of the tangential stabilizers. */
> float line2_sy   = 1.4; /* L: the sigma of the Y Gaussian (width). */
> float line2_sep  = 0.8; /* L: the separation of the lateral components. */
